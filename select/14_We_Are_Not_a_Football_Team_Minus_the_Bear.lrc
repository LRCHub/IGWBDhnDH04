[00:24.04] She was sitting on a swing
[00:31.29] And dangling her feet
[00:34.94] Like the leaves of a tree
[00:39.42] I think I heard her singing.
[00:53.42] 
[00:50.89] We're still out at 10 in the evening.
[01:09.39] 
[01:23.85] I knew her in the way that
[01:27.52] I knew not to speak.
[01:30.92] Quietly took a seat
[01:35.74] And thought I'd stay for a week.
